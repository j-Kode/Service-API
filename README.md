# Konnect Services API

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation & Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (In this case copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`, all the keys are for testing and environments will be deleted later):

## Running the Application

### Using Docker (Recommended)

Start the application and database with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The API will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Design Considerations

#### Service Version Entity

- Currently the entity exists in the same place as the Service, this is due to them being closely related and didn't need separate endpoints for this entity.

#### Security & Authorization

- Could implement role-based access control using Auth0 roles

#### Error Handling & Logging

- Current implementation uses console.log for error logging
- Could be improved with:
  - Structured logging using Winston
  - Error tracking service integration
  - Detailed error logs with request context
  - Custom error handling service

#### Data Management

- Soft delete functionality could be added to entities for better data tracking
- Would allow for:
  - Record recovery
  - Audit trailing
  - Maintaining referential integrity

## Assumptions

### Version Entity

- Assuming theres no other fields in table, I just have version number in there and description.

### Environment Variables

- Included `.env.example` with actual configuration values for ease of setup
- In a production environment, these values would never be committed to the repository
- Sensitive data would be managed through a secure secrets management system

### API Testing

- Included a Postman collection (`postman_collection.json`) in the repository
- Collection contains all available endpoints with:
  - Pre-configured requests
  - Example payloads
  - Environment variables
  - Tests for response validation
- Can be imported directly into Postman for immediate testing

Can be imported directly into Postman for immediate testing

## Configuration

The application can be configured using environment variables. See `.env.example` for available options.
